### Windows8 Update
There is an issue when using multiple synced instances of Windows8 all running WallMaster at the same time.  When an instance updates the wallpaper it willy automatically sync and update the each others.  The problem is exacerbated if the two computers don't have the the same number and orientation of monitors.

The work around is to disable synchronization of wallpapers.

0. Bring up charms (win+c)
0. Go to "Change PC Settings" (at the bottom)
0. Go to "sync your settings"
0. Disable desktop personalization 

Unfortunately, personalization is an all or nothing affair.
